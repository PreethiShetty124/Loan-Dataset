# Loan-Fifa-Dataset

# Loan Dataset

Loan Dataset contains null Values. These null values have been handled by using mean and mode. Certain features/columns in loan dataset are having categorical datatype.
These datatype are converted to numerical feature with the help of label encoder. Once all features contain numerical datatype, we split the data for training and testing 
data and then apply machine learning algorithms like Logistic Regression, SVM and Decision Tree to get the best possible accuracy for model prediction. I got the best accuracy 
for my model by using Logistic Regression.


# FIFA 19 Dataset

To gain insights of data appplied Exploratory Data Analysis on the FifaDataset.Converted the appropriate columns to machine understandable columns using label encoding
i.e converted all categorical datatype to numerical datatype.Handled Null values and Applied the correlation and variance to remove the column which are having high 
correlation and less variance.
